HTML, CSS, and Javascript developer with experience in OOP including Single Page Application using the MVP. Have been
developing since 2020. Can make layout adaptive and cross-browser. Have a bit of experience with React and Angular, and continue my learning.  
A quick learner. Have high attention to details and accuracy of work. Adaptable, driven, and responsible.

### SKILLS

- Javascript;
- SCSS, PUG;

- Git.

**Languages:**

### CODE EXAMPLE

###### Task: adapt kebab- & snake_case to camelCase.

\*Preferred solution

```
function toCamelCase(str) {
      const arr = Array.from(str);
      let positions = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] === '-' || arr[i] === '_') {
          positions.push(i + 1);
        }
      }

      return arr
        .map((el, index) => {
          return positions.includes(index) ? el.toUpperCase() : el;
        })
        .filter((el) => {
          return el !== '-' && el !== '_';
        })
        .join('');
    }
```

Can solve it shorter, but believe, more readable is better

```
function toCamelCase(str){
  return str.split(/[-_]/).map(function (entry, index) {
    return index === 0 ? entry : entry.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + entry.slice(1)
  }).join('');
}
```

### ABOUT ME

I have a degree in journalism, began to be interested in programming at school, but at that time we had programming lessons just in a graduate year, and that wasn’t enough to enter university. Studied myself and in 2020 understood that need a system education, and started courses.  
I take part in the game "What? Where? When?" (something like “Jeopardy”, but with the team), sort garbage, inspired by pixel-perfect which match from the first time, like knitting and cats.
